= A brief history of Colossal Cave Adventure =
by Eric S. Raymond

Adventure is the fons et origo of all later dungeon-crawling computer
games, the grandaddy of interactive fiction, and one of the hallowed
artifacts of hacker folklore.

== Origin and history ==

The very first version was released by Crowther in 1976, in FORTRAN on
the PDP-10 at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman. (Crowther was at the time
writing what we could now call firmware for the earliest ARPANET
routers.) It was a maze game based on the Colossal Cave complex in
Kentucky, including fewer of the D&D-like elements now associated with
the game.

Adventure as we now know it, the ancestor of all later versions, was
released on a PDP-10 at the Stanford AI Lab by Don Woods in 1977
(some sources, apparently erroneously, say 1976). That version is
sometimes known as 350-point Adventure.

Between 1977 and 1995 Crowther and Woods themselves continued to work
intermittently on the game. This main line of development culminated
in the 1995 release of Adventure 2.5, also known as 430-point Adventure

The earliest port to C was by Jim Gillogly under an early Unix running
at the Rand Corporation in 1977; this version was later, and still is,
included in the BSD Games collection.  I have it from Don Woods directly
that "[Jim Gillogly] was one of the first to request and receive a copy 
of the source" but that Woods did not actually know of the BSD port
until I briefed him on it in 2017.  (This contradicts some implications
in third-party histories.)

Many other people ported and extended the game in various directions.
A notable version was the first game shipped for the IBM Personal
Computer in 1981; neither Crowther nor Woods nor Gillogly were paid
royalties.

The history of these non-mainline versions is complex and
murky. Functional differences were generally marked by changes in the
maximum score as people added puzzles and rooms; however, multiple
ports of some versions existed - some in FORTRAN, some in C,
some in other languages - so the maximum point score is not
completely disambiguating.

Same articles at <<DA>> are a narrative of the history of the game.
There is an in-depth study of its origins at <<SN>>.  Many versions
are collected at The Interactive Fiction Archive <<IFA>>; note however
that IFA's historical claims are thinly sourced and its dates for the
earliest releases don't match either comments in the code or the
careful reconstruction in <<SN>>.

== Open Adventure ==

An attempt to untangle and document a lot of the non-mainline history
has been made by Arthur O'Dwyer at <<QUUX>>.  For our purposes, it
will suffice to explain the chain of provenance that led from the
original Adventure to the Open Adventure distributed with this
document.

The original 350-point ADVENT on the PDP-10 had been one of my
formative experiences as a fledgling hacker in 1976-77. Forty years
later, in February 2017, while doing some casual research into the
history of text adventure games, I looked through some source code at
<<IFA>> and was delighted to learn of Adventure 2.5, a version of the
Crowther-Woods mainline later than I had ever played.

Adventure 2.5 had been shipped long enough ago that today's conventions of
open-source licensing were not yet fully established. The Makefile
contained a rights reservation by Don Woods and that was it.

I wrote to Don asking permission to release 2.5 under 2-clause BSD;
he replied on 15 May 2017 giving both permission and encouragement.

Here is what Don said about differences between the original Adventure
and 2.5:

............................................................................

Great care has been taken to preserve 2.5's exact gameplay as intended
by Don.  However, under the hood Open Adventure is rather different from
2.5.  Where 2.5 was written in FORTRAN mechanically translated into extremely
ugly C, Open Adventure has been translated into much more modern and
idiomatic C.  The extremely cryptic and opaque format of the original
database of rooms, objects, and strings has been moved to YAML;
this makes the brilliant design of it much easier to comprehend.

== Earlier non-influences ==

There is record of one earlier dungeon-crawling game called "dnd",
written in 1974-75 on the PLATO system at University of Illinois
<<DND>>.  This was in some ways similar to later roguelike games but
not to Adventure.  The designers of later roguelikes frequently site
Adventure as an influence, but not dnd; like PLATO itself, dnd seems
not to have become known outside of its own user community until
rediscovered by computer historians many years after Adventure
shipped.

There was also Hunt The Wumpus <<WUMPUS>>, written by Gregory Yob in
1972. There is no evidence that Yob's original (circulated
in BASIC among microcomputer enthusiasts) was known to the ARPANET-
and minicomputer-centered culture Crowther and Woods were part of
until well after Adventure was written.

(I was a developer of the Nethack roguelike early in that game's
history, in the late 1980s; we knew nothing of PLATO dnd.  We did know
of Hunt The Wumpus then from its early Unix port, but it didn't
influence us either, nor in any apparent way the designers of other
early roguelikes. After my time the wumpus was included as a monster
in Nethack, but this was done in a spirit of conscious museumization
after historians rediscovered Yob's game.)

Neither of these games used an attempt at a natural-language parser
even as primitive as Adventure's.
