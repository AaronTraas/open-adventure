== NAME ==
advent - Colossal Cave Adventure

== SYNOPSIS ==
*advent* [-l logfile] [-o]

== DESCRIPTION ==
The original Colossal Cave Adventure from 1976 was the origin of all
text adventures, dungeon-crawl (computer) games, and computer-hosted
roleplaying games.

This is the last version released by Crowther & Woods, its original
authors, in 1995.  It has been known as "adventure 2.5" and "430-point
adventure".

There is an 'adventure' in the BSD games package that is a C port by
Jim Gillogly of the 1976 ancestor of this game.  To avoid a name
collision, this game builds as 'advent', reflecting the fact that the
PDP-10 on which it originally ran limited filenames to 6 characters.

This version is released as open source with the permission and
encouragement of the original authors.

== OPTIONS ==

-l:: Log commands to specified file.

-o:: Old-style.  Restores original interface, no prompt.
