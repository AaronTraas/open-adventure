= Installing Open Adventure =

The instructions below assume your system uses Python 3 by default,
but the actual Python code in Open Adventure is 2/3 agnostic. Adjust
the example commands below accordingly.

1. Install PyYAML for Python 3 (which requires Python 3), and libedit
(aka: editline) on your system.

On Debian and Ubuntu: 'apt-get install python3-yaml libedit-dev'.
On Fedora: 'dnf install python3-PyYAML libedit-devel'.

If you are using MacPorts on OS X: 'port install py3{5,6}-yaml', as
appropriate for your Python 3 version.

You can also use pip to install PyYAML: 'pip3 install PyYAML'.

2. 'make'.

3. Optionally run a regression test on the code with 'make check'.

4. Run the resulting 'advent' binary to play.

If make returns the following message:

./make_dungeon.py Traceback (most recent call last): File "./make_dungeon.py", line 10, in import sys, yaml ImportError: No module named yaml

try editing make_dungeon.py to change #!/usr/bin/env python to read
#!/usr/bin/env python3
