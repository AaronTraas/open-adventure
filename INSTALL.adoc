= Installing Open Adventure =

1. Install PyYAML for Python 3 (which requires Python 3), and libedit
(aka: editline) on your system.

On Debian and Ubuntu: 'apt-get install python3-yaml libedit-dev'.
On Fedora: 'dnf install python3-PyYAML libedit-devel'.

If you are using MacPorts on OS X: 'port install py3{5,6}-yaml', as
appropriate for your Python 3 version.

You can also use pip to install PyYAML: 'pip3 install PyYAML'.

2. 'make'.

3. Optionally run a regression test on the code with 'make check'.

4. Run the resulting 'advent' binary to play.
