You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

> resume
Can't open file y, try again.

You're at sw end.

The grate is locked.

> blast

There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.

It's a pity you took so long about it.

You scored 1000428 out of a possible 430, using 1 turn.

You just went off my scale!!

To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!
Congratulations!!
