Open Adventure is an author-approved open-source release of
Version 2.5 with, as yet, no gameplay changes.
Version 2.5 was essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the
hazards therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points.
There are a few more hints, especially for some of the more obscure
puzzles.  There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You
can now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a
while first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the
game.  Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than before.

> go back

>>Foof!<<

You're inside building.

There are some keys on the ground here.

There is a lamp shining nearby.

There is a bottle of water here.

> fuck

Watch it!

> fly

Though you flap your arms furiously, it is to no avail.

> say boo

Okay, "BOO".

> score

You have garnered 32 out of a possible 430 points, using 53 turns.

> quit

Do you really want to quit now?

> yes

OK

You scored 32 out of a possible 430, using 54 turns.

You are obviously a rank amateur.  Better luck next time.

To achieve the next higher rating, you need 14 more points.
