Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
have to enter "northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "north".
You can type "help" for some general hints.  For information on how
to end your adventure, scoring, etc., type "info".

This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther.  Most of the
features of the current program were added by Don Woods.

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

Open Adventure is an author-approved open-source release of
Version 2.5 with, as yet, no gameplay changes.
Version 2.5 was essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the
hazards therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points.
There are a few more hints, especially for some of the more obscure
puzzles.  There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You
can now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a
while first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the
game.  Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than before.
