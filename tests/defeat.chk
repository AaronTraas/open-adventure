mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.

covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

from the chasm into a winding corridor.

A rickety wooden bridge extends across the chasm, vanishing into the
mist.  A notice posted on the bridge reads, "Stop! Pay troll!"

You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.

There is a ferocious cave bear eying you from the far end of the room!

The bear is locked to the wall with a golden chain!

down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.

As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.
His aspect is stern as he advises: "One who wouldst traffic in
precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof."
He wrests the urn from the stone, leaving a small cavity.  Turning to
face you again, he fixes you with a steely eye and intones: "Caution!"
Genie and urn vanish in a cloud of amber smoke.  The smoke condenses
to form a rare amber gemstone, resting in the cavity in the rock.

The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...

You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A notice nearby reads: "Do
not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.

> sw

You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, "Treasure Vault.
Keys in main office."

The grate is locked.

There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far

in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
