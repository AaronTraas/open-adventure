A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.

You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!

Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
to try to reincarnate you?
