Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

rocky bed.

Upstream or downstream?

You're in valley.

At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.

> s

You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
leads into the depression.

The grate is locked.

I am prepared to give you a hint, but it will cost you 2 points.

Do you want the hint?

The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
looking elsewhere for the keys.
