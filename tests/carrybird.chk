You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

Seed set to 1071883378

You're in front of building.

You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.

There are some keys on the ground here.

There is a shiny brass lamp nearby.

There is food here.

There is a bottle of water here.

> take lamp

OK

> rub lamp

Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
nothing exciting happens.

> xyzzy

>>Foof!<<

It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.

> on

Your lamp is now on.

You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone
has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".

A three foot black rod with a rusty star on an end lies nearby.

> eat grate

I see no grate here.

> w

You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.

> w

You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
from east and west sides of the chamber.

A cheerful little bird is sitting here singing.

> take bird

You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.

> attack

The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
