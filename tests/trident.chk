You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris   
here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone
has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".

You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.

You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen 
rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit

the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone   
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the 
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.  

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.

The bird is singing to you in gratitude for your having returned it to
its home.  In return, it informs you of a magic word which it thinks  
you may find useful somewhere near the Hall of Mists.  The magic word 
changes frequently, but for now the bird believes it is "F'JBV".  You   
thank the bird for this information, and it flies off into the forest.

The ogre, who despite his bulk is quite agile, easily dodges your
attack.  He seems almost amused by your puny effort.   

One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you! 

The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a    
blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarves, who flee

around the boulders.

You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is   
fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet   
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.

The waters have parted to form a narrow path across the reservoir.

extremely dangerous.  Here at the base of the cliff lie the remains   
of several earlier adventurers who apparently failed to make it.

You are climbing along a nearly vertical cliff.

Just as you reach the top, your foot slips on a loose rock and you    
make one last desperate grab.  Your luck holds, as does your grip.    
With an enormous heave, you lift yourself to the ledge above.    

You are on a small ledge at the top of a nearly vertical cliff.

covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend    
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far    
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and    
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided   
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A  
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.

You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and 
walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A 
shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads   
up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.   

There is an enormous clam here with its shell tightly closed.    

> open clam

A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,   
this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying 
bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
