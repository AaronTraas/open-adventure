The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a
blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarf, who flees

You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.

The waters have parted to form a narrow path across the reservoir.

You are walking across the bottom of the reservoir.  Walls of water
rear up on either side.  The roar of the water cascading past is

of several earlier adventurers who apparently failed to make it.

You are climbing along a nearly vertical cliff.

You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.

from the chasm into a winding corridor.

The forest thins out here to reveal a steep cliff.  There is no way
down, but a small ledge can be seen to the west across the chasm.

A small urn is embedded in the rock.

You are currently holding the following:
Brass lantern
Small bottle
Oil in the bottle
Egg-sized emerald
Persian rug
Giant ruby

> fill urn

Your bottle is now empty and the urn is full of oil.

> light urn

The urn is now lit.

> rub urn

As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.
His aspect is stern as he advises: "One who wouldst traffic in
precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof."
He wrests the urn from the stone, leaving a small cavity.  Turning to
face you again, he fixes you with a steely eye and intones: "Caution!"
Genie and urn vanish in a cloud of amber smoke.  The smoke condenses
to form a rare amber gemstone, resting in the cavity in the rock.

> take amber

> drop rug

OK

> drop emerald

The gem fits easily into the cavity.

The persian rug stiffens and rises a foot or so off the ground.

> fly rug

Tsk!  A wizard wouldn't have to take 350 turns.  This is going to cost
you a couple of points.

You board the persian rug, which promptly whisks you across the chasm.
You have time for a fleeting glimpse of a two thousand foot drop to a
mighty river; then you find yourself on the other side.

You are on a small ledge on one face of a sheer cliff.  There are no
paths away from the ledge.  Across the chasm is a small clearing
surrounded by forest.

There is a persian rug here, hovering in mid-air!

A brilliant blue star sapphire is here!
