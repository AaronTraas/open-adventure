You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone
has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".

A three foot black rod with a rusty star on an end lies nearby.

passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.

Rough stone steps lead down the pit.

You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.

The wind whistles coldly past your ears.

A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.

You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
a rock in the room's center.

There is a little axe here.

You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.

The shadowy figure seems to be trying to attract your attention.

> y2

You're at "Y2".

There is a little axe here.
