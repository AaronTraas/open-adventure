A .tst extension means it's a game log
A .chk extension means it's expected output from a test

The test files are run in alphabetical order. This allows you to ensure certain tests are run in a particular order merely by giving them appropriate names, e.g.: test.1.log, test.2.log, test.3.log. This is useful for testing save and resume.

In general, a file named foo.chk is the expected output from theb game log
foo.log.  To add new tests, just drop log files in this directory.

To see summary lines from all tests, 'make testlist'.  The summary lines
are those led with ##; you should have one such descriptive line at the
head of the file.

To run the tests, "make regress".

To remake the check files, "make buildregress".
