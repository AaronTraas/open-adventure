Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?

> n

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

> thank

You're quite welcome.

> shazam

Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.

> help

I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
give you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected
effects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having
trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
different tack.  One point often confusing to beginners is that, when
there are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there
are several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect
chooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the
place you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.
Also, to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a
single word.  For example, "building" usually gets you to the building
from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note
that cave passages and forest paths turn a lot, so leaving one place
heading north doesn't guarantee entering the next from the south.
However (another important point), except when you've used a "long
distance" word such as "building", there is always a way to go back
where you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even
though the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of
what got you here.  Good luck, and have fun!

> no

OK

> tree

The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
spruce and berry bushes.

> dig

Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
progress is unlikely.

> lost

I'm as confused as you are.

> mist

Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
pit leading down to water.'

> fuck

Watch it!

> stop

I don't know the word "stop".  Use "quit" if you want to give up.

> info

For a summary of the most recent changes to the game, say "news".
If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend your
adventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
or "save").  To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full
credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,
though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points
for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.
There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've
managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for
getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack),
and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some
of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the
treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting
happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting
*DOES* happen (incidentally, there *ARE* ways to hasten things along),
it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
more points in the Master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
save time, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat the
full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.

> swim

I don't know how.

> wizard

Wizards are not to be disturbed by such as you.

> yes

Guess again.

> news

Open Adventure is an author-approved open-source release of
Version 2.5 with, as yet, no gameplay changes.
Version 2.5 was essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the
hazards therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points.
There are a few more hints, especially for some of the more obscure
puzzles.  There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You
can now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a
while first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the
game.  Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than before.


You scored 32 out of a possible 430, using 15 turns.

You are obviously a rank amateur.  Better luck next time.

To achieve the next higher rating, you need 14 more points.
