You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

There are some keys on the ground here.

There is a shiny brass lamp nearby.

There is food here.

There is a bottle of water here.

>>Foof!<<

It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.

> on

Your lamp is now on.

You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone
has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".

A three foot black rod with a rusty star on an end lies nearby.

> take rod

OK

> w

You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.

> w

You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
from east and west sides of the chamber.

A cheerful little bird is sitting here singing.

> w

At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.

Rough stone steps lead down the pit.

> d

You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.

> w

You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.

> wave rod

A crystal bridge now spans the fissure.

> w

You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.

There are diamonds here!

A crystal bridge spans the fissure.

You are at the west end of the Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl
continues west and another goes north.  To the south is a little
passage 6 feet off the floor.

> w

You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
round two foot hole slants down.

> w

You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
joins up with a narrow north/south passage.

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.

Dead end

There is a massive and somewhat battered vending machine here.  The
instructions on it read: "Drop coins here to receive fresh batteries."

> kill machine

As you strike the vending machine, it pivots backward along with a
section of wall, revealing a dark passage leading south.

> s

You are in a long, rough-hewn, north/south corridor.

> s

You are in a large chamber with passages to the west and north.

A formidable ogre bars the northern exit.

> attack

The ogre, who despite his bulk is quite agile, easily dodges your
attack.  He seems almost amused by your puny effort.
