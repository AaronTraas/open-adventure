You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris   
here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone
has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".  

A three foot black rod with a rusty star on an end lies nearby.

You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to  
the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone   
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the 
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.  

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.

You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.  
The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.

The bird is singing to you in gratitude for your having returned it to
its home.  In return, it informs you of a magic word which it thinks  
you may find useful somewhere near the Hall of Mists.  The magic word 
changes frequently, but for now the bird believes it is "Q'IBJ".  You   
thank the bird for this information, and it flies off into the forest.

The ogre, who despite his bulk is quite agile, easily dodges your
attack.  He seems almost amused by your puny effort.   

One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you! 

The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a    
blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarf, who flees

To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.

You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were   
large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
around the boulders.

You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in 
the wall above the pit at this end of the room.

You are in a secret n/s canyon above a large room.

You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is   
fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet   
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south. 

> Q'IBJ

The waters have parted to form a narrow path across the reservoir.

You are walking across the bottom of the reservoir.  Walls of water   
rear up on either side.  The roar of the water cascading past is 
nearly deafening, and the mist is so thick you can barely see.

You are at the northern edge of the reservoir.  A northwest passage

You are on a very steep incline, which widens at it goes upward.

You are at the base of a nearly vertical cliff.  There are some  
slim footholds which would enable you to climb up, but it looks  
extremely dangerous.  Here at the base of the cliff lie the remains   
of several earlier adventurers who apparently failed to make it. 

> u

You are climbing along a nearly vertical cliff.   

> u

Just as you reach the top, your foot slips on a loose rock and you    
make one last desperate grab.  Your luck holds, as does your grip.    
With an enormous heave, you lift yourself to the ledge above.    

You are on a small ledge at the top of a nearly vertical cliff.  
There is a low crawl leading off to the northeast.

You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend    
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far    
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and    
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided   
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A  
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is   
littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east 
and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the   
wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.  

There is a huge beanstalk growing out of the west pit up to the hole.

You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a  
profusion of leaves.

> w

You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your  
lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On 
the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic]. 

There is a large nest here, full of golden eggs!

You are at one end of an immense north/south passage. 

The way north is barred by a massive, rusty, iron door.

although it requires some effort.

You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades 
over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears  
through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.    

There is a jewel-encrusted trident here!

OK

You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could  
climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a   
passage leading back to the north.

You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, se, and sw.

This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the  
walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another   
passage leads se, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.   

There is a delicate, precious, ming vase here!    

> n

You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path 
exits to the south and west.

You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen after a short

north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage    
going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.

You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and 
walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A 
shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads   
up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.   

There is an enormous clam here with its shell tightly closed.

A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,   
this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying 
bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.

Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"

swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the 
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.  

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.
