Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.  
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and 
down a gully.

You're in front of building.

You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring. 

There are some keys on the ground here. 

There is a shiny brass lamp nearby.

There is food here. 

There is a bottle of water here.

You're in front of building.  

> s

You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a    
rocky bed.

> s

At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit 
in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.   

> s

You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the    
dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed    
leads into the depression.    

The grate is locked.

> open grate

The grate is now unlocked.    

> d

You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.

The grate is open.  

> w

You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light 
at the east end of the passage.    

There is a small wicker cage discarded nearby.    

> w

It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.

> light lamp

Your lamp is now on.

You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris   
here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone
has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".  

A three foot black rod with a rusty star on an end lies nearby.  

> w

You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.  

> w

You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen 
rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit    
from east and west sides of the chamber.

A cheerful little bird is sitting here singing.   

> w

At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east  
passage ends here except for a small crack leading on. 

Rough stone steps lead down the pit.    

> down

You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to  
the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone   
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the 
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.  

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.

> w

You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.  
The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.    

> jump

You didn't make it. 

Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to 
help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me 
to try to reincarnate you?
