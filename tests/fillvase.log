## Fill the vase

# (4) Lastly, here's a test case for you! Go get the VASE; then get the
# PILLOW; then go back to the stream (any stream) and DROP PILLOW; then FILL
# VASE. What should happen? This is a trick question, because literally every
# historical version of Adventure has *some* bug here. They duplicate
# messages (MCDO0551), or the vase shatters and then shows up re-formed but
# immobile (WOOD0350, WOOD0430), or the vase shows up shattered but still in
# your inventory (KNUT0350), or... So you get to pick your behavior! From the
# code, I think you're faithfully emulating WOOD0430's bug.

# Turns out we fixed this, perhaps inadvertently.
