Open Adventure is an open-source port of Colossal Cave Adventure
approved by its original authors, Will Crowther and Don Woods. It is
based not on the original 350-point version from 1977 with 15
treasures, but on the 430-point version with 20 treasures that was the
last one Don Woods released in 1995.
