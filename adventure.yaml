# This YAML file gets processed into a collection of data structures and
# variable initializers describing Colossal Cave.  It replaces an ad-hoc
# text database shipped with Adventure versions up to 2.5.  The format
# change enabled a lot of use of symbolic names where there were previously
# inscrutable numeric literals.
#
# We define a bunch of YAML structures:
#
# vocabulary: Almost all the words the game knows - one of them gets
#    replaced with a randomly-generated cookie.  Fpor each word there
#    is a type (motion, action, object, or special) and a numeric value.
#    Multiple synonyms may have the same value.
#
# hints: Each item contains a hint number (add 10 to get cond bit),
#    a hint label (used to generate the value macro for the hint) 
#    the number of turns he must be at the right loc(s) before
#    triggering the hint, the points deducted for taking the hint, the
#    message number (section 6) of the question, and the message
#    number of the hint.  These values are stashed in the "hints"
#    array.
#
# locations: They have attributes as follows...
#
#    long:         Long description, always shown on first encounter.
#    short:        Short description. If none, use long description.
#    conditions:   A dictionary of attributes
#        LIT		Light
#        OILY		If FLUID flag is on: true for oil, false for water
#        FLUID		Liquid asset
#        NOARRR		Pirate doesn't go here unless following player
#        NOBACK		Cannot use "back" to move away
#        HCAVE		Trying to get into cave
#        HBIRD		Trying to catch bird
#        HSNAKE		Trying to deal with snake
#        HMAZE		Lost in maze
#        HDARK		Pondering dark room
#        HWITT		At Witt's End
#        HCLIFF		Cliff with urn
#        HWOODS		Lost in forest
#        HOGRE		Trying to deal with ogre
#        HJADE		Found all treasures except jade
#    hints:        A list of YAML references to hints that may be available at
#                  this location. (This is why locations has to follow hints.)
#    sound:        Label for a location sound.
#    loud:         If true, object sounds are drowned out at this location.
#
#    All attributes are optional except the long description. Order of
#    locations is not significant.
#
# arbitrary_messages: These are arguments to rspeak(). Some spans of
#    these messages need to be kept adjacent and ordered (for now).
#    To see which, grep for rspeak() calls containing expressions with
#    arithmetic.  Eventually, these will be pulled out into more appropriate
#    data structures. Then ordering can be dropped, and gaps removed.
#
# classes: Each item contains a point threshold and a message
#    describing a classification of player.  Point thresholds must be
#    in ascending order. The scoring code selects the appropriate
#    message, where each message is considered to apply to players
#    whose scores are higher than the previous N but not higher than
#    this N.  Note that these scores probably change with every
#    modification (and particularly expansion) of the program.
#
# turn_thresholds:  Each item contains a number and a message
#    berating the player for taking so many turns.  When the turn count
#    matches one of the thresholds, the corresponding message is shown.
#    Order doesn't matter; the logic simply tests every threshold on
#    the assumption that turn counts never decrease nor skip values.
#
# objects: Each item contains a description for use in the inventory command
#    and one or more messages describing the object in different states.
#    There is also a boolean "treasure" attribute, defaulting to false.
#    An pbject may have one or two start locations (the gate is an example
#    of a two-location object; it can be accessed from above or below).
#    An object may also be flagged immovable, meaning it cannot be carried.
#    If a state message is a tuple then the first element is made the name
#    of a #define viible to the code for the associayed state, numbered
#    from zero upwards. If the inventory desription begins with "*" the
#    object is dungeon furniture that cannot be taken or carried.
#
# obituaries: Death messages and reincarnation queries.  Order is
#    significant, they're used in succession as the player racks up
#    deaths.
#
# These correspond to sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 in
# the old adventure.text format.  Sections 3, 4, and 8 haven't moved
# yet.  Section 12 was obsolete.
#
# Message strings may include certain special character sequences to
# denote that the program must provide parameters to insert into a
# message when the message is printed.  These sequences are:
#	%S = The letter 'S' or nothing (if a given value is exactly 1)
#	%W = A word (up to 10 characters)
#	%L = A word mapped to lower-case letters
#	%U = A word mapped to upper-case letters
#	%C = A word mapped to lower-case, first letter capitalised
#	%T = Several words of text, ending with a word of -1
#	%1 = A 1-digit number
#	%2 = A 2-digit number
#	...
#	%9 = A 9-digit number
#	%B = Variable number of blanks
#	%! = The entire message should be suppressed

- CAVE_NEARBY: 'Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in\ntreasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never\nseen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes\nand hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.

- VOCAB_DESCRIPTION: 'I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary\ndescribes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words\nlike forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,\nup, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod\nhidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of\nthe action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the\nobject and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer\nthe object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in\nparticular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to\ngive you a list of what you''re carrying.  Some objects have unexpected\neffects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having\ntrouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people\ntrying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something\nbeyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely\ndifferent tack.  One point often confusing to beginners is that, when\nthere are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there\nare several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect\nchooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the\nplace you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.\nAlso, to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a\nsingle word.  For example, "building" usually gets you to the building\nfrom anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note\nthat cave passages and forest paths turn a lot, so leaving one place\nheading north doesn''t guarantee entering the next from the south.\nHowever (another important point), except when you''ve used a "long\ndistance" word such as "building", there is always a way to go back\nwhere you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even\nthough the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of\nwhat got you here.  Good luck, and have fun!'

- NEED_DETAIL: 'I need more detailed instructions to do that.'
- NEARBY: 'I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate\nthings.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.'

- HARD_GRATE: 'The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot\nenter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend\nlooking elsewhere for the keys.'
- FOREST_LOOK: 'The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an\noccasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-\ngrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of\nvarious sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by\nall the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the\nspruce and berry bushes.'

To suspend your\nadventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"\nor "save").  To see how well you''re doing, say "score".  To get full\ncredit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,\nthough you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points\nfor getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.\nThere are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you''ve\nmanaged to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for\ngetting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack),\nand there are other ways to determine whether you''ve been through some\nof the more harrowing sections.  If you think you''ve found all the\ntreasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting\nhappens, you haven''t found them all yet.  If something interesting\n*DOES* happen (incidentally, there *ARE* ways to hasten things along),\nit means you''re getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many\nmore points in the Master''s section.  I may occasionally offer hints\nif you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I''ll warn you in advance\nhow much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to\nsave time, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat the\nfull description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.'
