= README for Open Adventure =

This code is a forward-port of the Crowther/Woods Adventure 2.5 from
1995, last version in the main line of Colossal Cave Adventure
development written by the original authors.  The authors have given
permission and encouragement for this release.

The file history.txt contains a more detailed history of this game
and its ancestors.

This project is called "Open Adventure" because it's not at all clear
how to number Adventure past 2.5 without misleading or causing
collisions or both.  See the history file for discussion.  The
original 6-character name on the PDP-10 has been reverted to for the
executable in order to avoid a collision with the BSD games port of
the ancestral 1977 version.

You can run a regression test on the code with 'make check'.
