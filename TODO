The FORTRANish mess that once was is now mostly idiomatic C. Some issues
remain to be cleaned up:

* Remaining unstructured gotos in do_command().

* The program is still pretty much typeless - full of magic numbers being
  sliced and diced in cryptic ways.  Some attempt has been made to introduce
  semantic types, but the job is barely started.

We are aware that the lamp currently used as the project logo is a
hurricane lamp, not a proper miner's lamp. Submissions of potential
replacement images would be welcome.
