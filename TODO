The FORTRANish mess that once was is now mostly idiomatic C. Some issues
remain to be cleaned up:

* The remaining shared globals: WD1, WD1X, WD2, WD2X. These are used
  rather promiscuously to pass around information that ought to be function
  arguments in a modern language.

* Remaining unstructured gotos in playermove() and do_command(). The goto L12
  in playermove() is particularly horrible, jumping backwards into the
  middle of a loop.

* The program is still pretty much typeless - full of magic numbers being
  sliced and diced in cryptic ways.  Some attempt has been made to introduce
  semantic types, but the job is barely started.
