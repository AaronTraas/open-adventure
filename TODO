The FORTRANish mess that once was is now mostly idiomatic C. Some issues
remain to be cleaned up:

* The remaining shared globals: WD1, WD1X, WD2, WD2X. These are used
  rather promiscuously to pass around information that ought to be function
  arguments in a modern language.

* Remaining unstructured gotos in playermove() and do_command(). The goto L12
  in playermove() is particularly horrible, jumping backwards into the
  middle of a loop.

* The way return values from handlers such as 2012 trigger side effects
  based on global state is nasty.
