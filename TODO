The FORTRANish mess that once was is now mostly idiomatic C. Some issues
remain to be cleaned up:

* The remaining shared globals: K, SPK, WD1, WD1X, WD2, WD2X. These are used
  rather promiscuously to pass around information that ought to be function
  arguments in a modern language. K and SPK are particular offenders

* Remaining unstructured gotos in playermove() and do_command(). The goto L12
  in playermove() is particularly horrible, jumping backwards into the
  middle of a loop.

* In playermove(), why doesn't replacing the global motion number K
  with a passed-in argument work? There's some unobvious information
  leak here.

* The way return values from handlers such as 2012 trigger side effects
  based on global state such as K and SPK is nasty.
